There is almost 20 megabytes of data from the years 2012 through 2015. 

Each Observation in the data includes several variables, date, time, air temperature, barometric pressure, dew point and etc.

# Goals
* Returning a coefficient of the slope of the barometric pressure between beginning date and time and endindg date and time.
* Based on coefficients generate a graph that makes easier to interpret the weather.
